# MysteryMaze---LED-Matrix-Game

<details><summary> :bricks: Task requierment :bricks: </summary>
  I need to make a game on an 8x8 LED Matrix using a joystick, button, buzzer or everything else I want to add. The overall goal is to make a game that feels like a game, it should be fun to play and it should have a nice and intuitive menu.

  <details><summary> :joystick: Game Idea and The Game Itself :joystick: </summary>

  <p>I will be honest the idea for my game it is inspired from a mini-game. All you need to do is to follow the path and reach the end. Now the tricky part is that the path is more like a maze, and it not visible... at least not at all times. The path flashes for you, and you need to remeber it so you can reach the end. Along the path are some beacon that lights the tiles around them. (tbh this is supposed to help you but at this state I swear to god they do more against you than for you.. but oh well..).</p>
  <p>To win the game you need to reach the end alive, and for you to lose is to lose all your hearths, can lose a heart by making a misstep and not go along the path </p>

  When you power up the game:
    <p></p>1. A greetings message appears to welcome you into the game</p>
    <p></p>2. The menu follows after some second and has multiple options :</p>
        <p> - Start Game, pressing the button gets you where you can choose your name, and then can play the game itself</p>
        <p> -  Leaderboard, it should show you the 3 highest scores but oh well it's not implemented</p>
        <p> - Settings, a sub-menu with multiple option like game difficulty, LCD and Matrix brightness and an option to choose sound On/Off</p>
        <p> - How to Play, explaining really short what you should do in the game</p>
        <p>  - About, showing the github of the author, where the game can be found</p>
    <p>3. During the game, your time in the run is displayed as well as your lives</p>
    <p>4. When the player wins, the Matrix will show a happy face, and the LCD will show a congratulations message and the times he eneded with</p>
    <p>5. If the player loses, the Matrix will show a sad face, and the LCD wiil show a game over message with the option to restart the game</p>
